## Intro  
A visualized tool to build financial neural network models.  
(Chrome) Homepage: [[Neural Fintech]](http://www.neuralfintech.com/)  
The current source code is ugly, I will push the code after the first developing period.   
Alternatively, you could review the page code through the "view source code" in browser.
